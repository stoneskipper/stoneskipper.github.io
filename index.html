      <h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am constantly scanning my surroundings for wood that I can turn into furniture or art. I like difficult wood. Cracks and knots and wild grain. My favorite pieces of wood have traveled places and done hard labor. Some of the wood I have used formed the skids on a pallet that held tractors for delivery. Some was tropical hardwoods used to construct crates carrying grape juice concentrate from Brazil to New Jersey. It was an old wooden ladder that I fished out of the Ohio River where it got lodged in some flotsam after a flood.
</p>
<p>
Most of the wood that I use presents challenges. Removing thousands of nails takes time and sweat. I love it. Carefully milling the most warped and twisted boards from far-off sawmills takes careful appreciation and an understanding of how wood works. I know what I can cut out and what I can keep to make this wood behave or to allow it to be unruly when the use case permits.
</p>
<p>
It would be impossible to fake the type of stress and duress that has been faced by my favorite pieces of wood. When you examine more closely, you will see the telltale signs of wood that faced adversity before finding a new purpose - against odds and typical reason - in a piece of carefully crafted furniture. It would be much easier to buy refined and dignified boards from a sawmill or a dealer. But it would not be as fun or interesting. What my methods may appear to lack where business sensibility and efficiency are concerned, is more than made up for in the pride and amusement I feel.
</p>
<p>
I hope that some of you reading this may be able to recognize the unlikely nature - the long and winding route - which brought these pieces of wood together to form the furniture you find here. I hope that some people will find value and excitement in knowing the origins of the wood that makes their piece of furniture, and the motivations and peculiarities of the person who made it. I hope you can see what I see and relate.

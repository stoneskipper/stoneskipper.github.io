      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am constantly scanning my surroundings for wood that I can turn into furniture or art. I like difficult wood. Cracks and knots and wild grain. My favorite pieces of wood have traveled places and done hard labor. Some of the wood I have used formed the skids on a pallet that held tractors for delivery. Some was tropical hardwoods used to construct crates carrying grape juice concentrate from Brazil to New Jersey. It was an old wooden ladder that I fished out of the Ohio River where it got lodged in some flotsam after a flood.

        Most of the wood that I use presents challenges. Removing thousands of nails takes time and sweat. I love it. Carefully milling the most warped and twisted boards from far-off sawmills takes careful appreciation and an understanding of how wood works. I know what I can cut out and what I can keep to make this wood behave or to allow it to be unruly when the use case permits.
